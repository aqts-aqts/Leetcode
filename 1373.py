# To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming
# We will define two hash maps, one for the sum of all nodes in a subtree and one for whether a subtree is a BST
# To differentiate nodes from each other in the hash maps, we will map using the id of the node
# We have two helper functions, one to calculate the sum of all nodes in a subtree and one to check if a subtree is a BST
# To calculate the sum of all nodes in a subtree, we will use recursion
# We simply return the sum of the root, the sum of the left subtree and the sum of the right subtree
# To check if a subtree is a BST, we will use recursion as well
# This is a lot more complicated than it seems, as both subtrees being BSTs doesn't mean that the current subtree is a BST (even if root.left.val < root.val < root.right.val)
# This is because the left subtree might have a value greater than root.val and the right subtree might have a value less than root.val
# To get past this, we return a tuple of three values: whether the subtree is a BST, the min value in the subtree, and the max value in the subtree
# We can then confirm a BST with: if both subtrees are BSTs and the max value in the left subtree is less than the root and the min value in the right subtree is greater than the root
# To avoid recalculating the same subproblems, we will use memoization, which is the process of storing the results of subproblems so that we can use them later
# After each helper function call, we will store the result in the hash map with the id of the node as the key
# We can then do a simple inorder traversal of the tree and use the helper functions to find the maximum sum of a BST
# The time complexity of this is O(nÂ²) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
